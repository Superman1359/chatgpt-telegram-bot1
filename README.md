A ChatGPT bot for Telegram based on Node.js. Works with Cloudflare protection.

> üîî **NOTICE (Feb. 9, 2023)**: Currently, we are sticking with ChatGPT API [version 3](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/tree/v3) instead of [version 4](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api) for several reasons:
> - The v4 API relies on a leaked model that is not officially supported and is subject to change at any time, making it less reliable than v3.
> - The v4 API may incur charges while v3 is free.
> - The v3 API will [continue to be maintained](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/pull/294).

## Usage

### Start the server

> **Note** This bot uses a [browser-based ChatGPT API](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api), please make sure you have Node.js >= 18 and a Chromium-based browser installed.

To get started, follow these steps:

1. Make a copy of the file `.env.example` and rename it as `.env`.
2. In the `.env` file, enter your OpenAI account information and Telegram bot token. Set `IS_GOOGLE_LOGIN` to `true` if you're using Google auth.
3. Specify the ID of the users and groups who are permitted to use this bot. Separate multiple IDs with commas (`,`). Note that all members of the specified groups will have access to the bot inside the group. **If you leave these options empty, every person and group will be able to use the bot.**
4. If the browser is not installed in the default location, specify its executable path. You can also specify proxy settings, if needed.
5. Specify the `NOPECHA_KEY` or `CAPTCHA_TOKEN` if you're using the corresponding CAPTCHA solver.
6. You can also specify the command to invoke the bot in group chats. The default command is `/chat`.
7. Set `IS_PRO_ACCOUNT` to `true` if you're using a premium / pro / paid account.

Then you can start the bot with:

```shell
pnpm install
pnpm build && pnpm start
```

### Chat with the bot in Telegram

To chat with the bot in Telegram, you can:

- Send direct messages to the bot (this is not supported in groups)
- Send messages that start with the specified command (e.g., `/chat` or the command you specified in the `.env` file)
- Reply to the bot's last message

> **Note** Make sure you have enabled the privacy mode of your bot before adding it to a group, or it will reply to every message in the group.

The bot also has several commands.

- `/help`: Show help information.
- `/reset`: Reset the current chat thread and start a new one.
- `/reload` (admin required): Refresh the ChatGPT session.

> **Note** When using a command in a group, make sure to include a mention after the command, like `/help@chatgpt_bot`.


## Advanced

### Running the bot on a headless server

You can use [Xvfb](https://www.x.org/releases/X11R7.6/doc/man/man1/Xvfb.1.xhtml) to create a virtual framebuffer on a headless server and run this program:

```shell
xvfb-run -a --server-args="-screen 0 1280x800x24 -nolisten tcp -dpi 96 +extension RANDR" pnpm start
```

We recommend you to use Google auth to avoid the complicated login Recaptchas. If you use a OpenAI account, you may have to use nopecha or 2captcha or manually solve the Recaptcha (by connecting to the display server using x11vnc). For more details about CAPTCHA solving, please refer to [the api repository](https://github.com/transitive-bullshit/chatgpt-api/#captchas).

#### Docker

You can also try this docker image by running the following command from the project root folder:

```shell
docker compose up
```
